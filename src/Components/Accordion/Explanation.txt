ðŸ“Œ What happens when you click Single Mode (default mode)
ðŸ‘‰ When the component loads, multiple is false by default â†’ so it starts in single mode.
ðŸ‘‰ answer is null initially â†’ no answers are shown.

âœ… When you click the button for a question:

The showanswer(id) function runs.

It checks: Is this ID already selected (i.e., answer === id)?

If yes â†’ deselect it by setting answer = null.

If no â†’ select it by setting answer = id.

ðŸ‘‰ The JSX checks: answer === item.id ? item.answer : null

It shows the answer only for that one selected question.

Clicking the same button again will hide the answer.

âš¡ Single mode ensures only one answer can be visible at a time.

ðŸ“Œ What happens when you click to switch to Multiple Mode
ðŸ‘‰ When you click the mode toggle button:

The Togglemode function runs.

It flips multiple to true.

It resets answer to an empty array ([]) â†’ so no answers are shown initially.

âœ… Now when you click a button for a question:

The showmultipelans(id) function runs.

It checks: Is this ID already in the answer array?

If yes â†’ remove it from the array â†’ that answer will hide.

If no â†’ add it to the array â†’ that answer will show.

ðŸ‘‰ The JSX checks: answer.includes(item.id) ? item.answer : null

It shows the answers for all IDs that are present in the answer array.

You can show/hide multiple answers independently.

âš¡ Multiple mode lets you display answers for many questions at once.
